# Project Name
Hot Restaurant

## Description
The Hot Restaurant app is your one stop shop to get your table booked at the Hot Restaurant. Due to the overwhelming popularity of our restaurant we will also offer a waiting list so you too can experience Hot Restaurant!

## Motivation
With the Hot Restaurant app we aim to:
1. Allow all the beautiful people of this great city to book a table at our restaurant or
2. Get your name on the waiting list

## Results
The Hot Restaurant app will display users with a home page, give them options to view tables, make a reservation and also links to view api information.

## Team Efforts
Work was broke amongst three developers: Front-end, Back-end and a Relese Manager.

## Individual Responsibilities.
Chase Cannon - Handled the majority of the front-end including the html, css and client side JavaScript.
Brad Ham - Handled the majority of the back-end including the server side JavaScript and API.
Cameron Wilson - Handled the GitHub repository setup, managing the merging of pull requests and assisted the other developers with research and advice.

### Challenges
Dealing with the API calls

## Improvements
We would like to include a wait time for those on the wait list and implement a calendar for future bookings.
